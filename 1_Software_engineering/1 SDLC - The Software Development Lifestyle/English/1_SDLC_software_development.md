   - **Outcome**: Source code that is maintainable, secure, and efficient.

4. **Testing**
   - **Description**: Consists of validating the software to ensure it meets the requirements defined in the SRS and is free of defects. Includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.
   - **Outcome**: Software that is functional, reliable, and ready for deployment.

5. **Releases**
   - **Description**: The process of distributing the software to users. May include alpha releases (internal), beta releases (limited to external users for testing), and general availability (GA, final market release).
   - **Outcome**: Software available for use by the public or a selected group.

6. **Documentation**
   - **Description**: Creating documents that describe how the software works and how to use it. System documentation is aimed at technical users, while user documentation is directed at non-technical end-users.
   - **Outcome**: Materials such as user manuals, quick start guides, and internal technical documentation that facilitate the use and maintenance of the software.

### Importance
- These processes ensure that the software not only meets user needs but is also of high quality, reducing risks and costs associated with failures and inefficient maintenance. Additionally, they facilitate effective communication and coordination within development teams and with stakeholders.

## Requirements

### Requirements Gathering Process
1. **Identification of Stakeholders**: Involve all groups affected by the software product, such as decision-makers, end-users, system administrators, and sales personnel.
2. **Establishment of Goals and Objectives**: Define broad outcomes and specific measurable actions that the software must achieve.
3. **Requesting Requirements from Stakeholders**: Use methods such as surveys, questionnaires, and interviews to collect needs and expectations.
4. **Documentation of Requirements**: Record all obtained requirements clearly and precisely so that they are understandable to all involved.
5. **Analysis and Confirmation of Requirements**: Ensure that requirements are consistent, clear, and complete, and obtain approval from stakeholders.
6. **Prioritization of Requirements**: Sort requirements into categories such as must-haves, highly desired, and nice-to-haves, ordering them within these categories if possible.

### Specification Documents
1. **User Requirement Specification (URS)**
   - **Purpose**: Captures the business needs and expectations of the end-users of the software system.
   - **Content**: User stories or use cases that answer who, what, and why of the user regarding the software.

2. **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)**
   - **Purpose**: Defines in detail the functionalities that the software must perform and the performance standards it must achieve.
   - **Content**: Includes statements of purpose, project scope, constraints, assumptions, dependencies, and detailed categories of requirements (functional, external interface features, system characteristics, and non-functional).

3. **System Requirement Specification (SysRS)**
   - **Purpose**: Describes the requirements for an entire system, not just the software.
   - **Content**: System capabilities, user interfaces, and features, along with policy, regulation, personnel, performance, security, and necessary hardware requirements.

## Methodologies

### Software Development Approaches
1. **Waterfall (Cascade)**
   - **Description

**: A sequential method where each phase must be completed before starting the next. Complete planning is done at the beginning.
   - **Advantages**: Easy to understand and manage. Each stage has clear deliverables and a review process.
   - **Disadvantages**: Inflexible to changes once a stage is completed. Does not adapt well to projects where requirements may evolve.

2. **V-Model (V-Shape Model)**
   - **Description**: Similar to Waterfall but with an additional emphasis on planning and executing tests at each corresponding development phase.
   - **Advantages**: Tests planned from the start of the project. Each development phase has a corresponding testing phase.
   - **Disadvantages**: Like Waterfall, it is inflexible once the development phases have begun and difficult to adapt to changes in requirements.

3. **Agile (Agile)**
   - **Description**: An iterative approach that allows for rapid adaptation to changes. Work is carried out in short cycles or sprints, which facilitates the incorporation of feedback and changes.
   - **Advantages**: Very flexible and adaptable to changes in requirements. Promotes continuous collaboration between the development team and stakeholders.
   - **Disadvantages**: May be more difficult to manage in terms of budget and time due to its iterative nature. Less defined initial planning can lead to uncertainty in the scope of the project.

### Comparison of Methodologies
- **Waterfall and V-Shape**: Both methods are preferred in projects where requirements are clear from the start and are unlikely to change. They are easy to understand and manage but lack the flexibility needed to adapt to changes.
- **Agile**: Ideal for projects that require flexibility and where requirements may change or are not fully defined at the start. Agile allows for quick adaptations but requires constant management and coordination to ensure success.

### Notes
- Agile is currently the most popular in many software development environments due to its adaptability and focus on continuous delivery of value.

## Software Versions

### General
- Software versions are essential both for users and developers. They allow users to know which version they are using and developers to provide critical updates and changes to the software. Version control helps track these updates and changes over time.

### Version Numbering
- **Common Format**: Version numbers can vary in length and meaning, but typically follow a format that can have 2 to 4 sets of numbers, separated by dots. Examples:
  - **Initial Version**: 1.0
  - **Version with Minor Patches**: 1.0.1
  - **Version with Major Changes**: 2.0
  - **Version with Build or Date**: 2.0.1.2023
- **Beta Versions**: Might have numbers below 1, such as 0.9, indicating that they are still in the testing phase.

### Semantic Versioning
- **First Number**: Major changes that often indicate new versions of the software.
- **Second Number**: Minor changes that improve functions or add new features without altering the main operation.
- **Third Number**: Patches or minor bug fixes.
- **Fourth Number**: Build number or build date, indicates less significant changes.

### Version Verification
- To verify the version of software, such as a web browser, it is usually accessed through:
  - Help menu
  - "About" section
- Example with Google Chrome: Menu > Help > About

### Version Compatibility
- **Backward Compatibility**: A crucial aspect for users and developers, allowing older versions of the software to work with the new.
- **Challenges**: Often, new versions can present compatibility issues with previous versions, which may require an update to resolve operational problems.

## Software Testing

### Types of Tests
1. **Functional Tests**: Evaluate the functionality of the software to ensure it meets the specified requirements. Black box tests are performed without considering the source code.
2. **Non-Functional Tests**: Evaluate aspects of the software such as performance, security, scalability, and availability. These tests are crucial to ensuring that the software's behavior under extreme conditions or under heavy loads is adequate.
3. **Regression Tests**: Performed to ensure that recent changes, such as updates or bug fixes, do not negatively affect existing functionalities.

### Testing Levels
1. **Unit Tests**: Verify the functionality of individual components of the code, generally at the function or module level. They are performed by developers.
2. **Integration Tests**: After individual modules pass unit tests, they are integrated and tested together to identify problems in the interaction between modules.
3. **System Tests**: Performed on a fully integrated system to verify compliance with specified requirements. They evaluate both functional and non-functional aspects.
4. **Acceptance Tests**: Executed by the client or end-user to determine if the system meets their needs and requirements.

### Testing Process
- **Requirements Gathering**: Before testing, system requirements must be well defined and documented.
- **Writing Test Cases**: Test cases should be written with clear details on steps, inputs, and

 expected outputs.
- **Test Execution**: Test cases are executed according to the level and type of test. Results are documented, and error tracking is conducted.
